## PowerShell's execution policy

[PowerShell's execution policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies) is a safety feature that controls the conditions under which PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts. This feature helps prevent the execution of malicious scripts.

Load a powershell shell with execution policy bypassed :

```powershell
C:\> powershell -ep bypass
```
