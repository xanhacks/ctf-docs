# Wi-Fi Security

WiFi security algorithms have been through many changes and upgrades since the 1990s to become more secure and effective.

Wireless security protocols goals :

- Prevent unwanted parties from connecting to your wireless network.
- Encrypt your private data sent over the airwaves.

Wireless / Wired networks :

- Wired networks transmit data by a network cable (more secure).
- Wireless networks broadcast it within their range in every direction to every connected device that happens to be listening.

## WEP - Wired Equivalent Privacy

WEP standard was approved in 1999 and officially abandoned in 2004.

WEP uses a RC4 stream encryption algorithm (64, 128, 256 bits key), CRC-32 for checksum and OSA/SKA for authentication.

The RC4 algorithm is no longer considered safe to use.

## WPA - Wi-Fi Protected Access

WPA was formally adopted in 2003.

**WPA Personal :**

- use a Pre-Shared Key (PSK) for authentication
- use a Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) for encryption

**WPA Enterprise :**

- use an authentication server for keys and certificates generation

Attacks on WPA are often linked to WPS.

### WPS - Wireless Protected Setup

WPS was introduced in 2006.

**WPS** was developed to simplify the linking of devices to modern access points instead of using long passphrases.

**Methods** for adding a device to the network :

- **PIN** : Enter the PIN from the access point (often display on screen).
- **Push button** : Push a button on both the access point and the new wireless client device.
- **Near-field communication** : Bring the new client close to the access point to allow NFC.
- **USB** : Use an USB to transfer data between client and access point.

## WPA2 - Wi-Fi Protected Access v2

The most important improvement of WPA2 over WPA was the usage of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

At this time the main vulnerability to a WPA2 system is when the attacker already has access to a secured WiFi network and can gain access to certain keys to perform an attack on other devices on the network.

The possibility of attacks via the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), is still high in the current WPA2-capable access points

## WPA3 - Wi-Fi Protected Access v3

**Improvements :**

- WPA3 will protect against dictionary attacks by implementing a new key exchange protocol. WPA2 used an imperfect four-way handshake between clients and access points to enable encrypted connections.
- If your passphrase gets compromised : WPA3 supports forward secrecy, meaning that any traffic that came across your transom before an outsider gained access will remain encrypted. With WPA2, they can decrypt old traffic as well.

## Secure your Wi-Fi

- Try to use WPA2/WPA3 instead of WPA and WEP (WEP is very insecure).
- Use a strong password (up to 63 characters for WPA/WPA2)
- Deactivate Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) on WPA/WPA2
