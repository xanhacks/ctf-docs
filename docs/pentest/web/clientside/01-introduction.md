# Pentesting web client side

## Same-origin policy (SOP)

The same-origin policy is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded by one origin can interact with a resource from another origin.

Two URLs have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.

For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. For example, XMLHttpRequest and the Fetch API follow the same-origin policy. This means that a web application using those APIs can only request resources from the same origin the application was loaded from **unless the response from other origins includes the right CORS headers**.
