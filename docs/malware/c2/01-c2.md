# Command & Control

A command and control (C&C) infrastructure consists of servers and other technical infrastructure used to control malware in general, and, in particular, botnets.

Command and control servers may be either directly controlled by the malware operators, or themselves run on hardware compromised by malware.

## Vocabulary

- **Listeners** are fairly self-explanatory. They listen for a connection and facilitate further exploitation.
- **Stagers** are essentially payloads generated by Empire to create a robust reverse shell in conjunction with a listener. They are the delivery mechanism for agents.
- **Agents** are the equivalent of a Metasploit "Session". They are connections to compromised targets, and allow an attacker to further interact with the system.
- **Modules** are used to in conjunction with agents to perform further exploitation. For example, they can work through an existing agent to dump the password hashes from the server.
