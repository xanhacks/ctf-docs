# Compiler options

- `-g` : Enable debugging information.
- `-s` : Strip the binary (remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable)
    - `.dynsym` : will be loaded into memory when the program is started.
    - `.symtab` : not loaded into memory and is therefore not necessary to execute the program.
    - The section `.symtab` is removed by `-s`.
