# Anti-Virus evasion

## Methodology

1. AV Fingerprinting
    - Tools : [SharpEDRChecker](https://github.com/PwnDexter/SharpEDRChecker), [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt)
    - Social engineering
2. Replicates the victim environment to test our payloads


!!! info
    We should always disable any kind of cloud-based protection in the AV settings (potentially by outright disconnecting the VM from the internet) so that the AV doesn't upload our carefully crafted payloads to a server somewhere for analysis.


- On-Disk evasion
- In-Memory evasion
