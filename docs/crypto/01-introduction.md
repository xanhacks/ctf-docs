# Cryptography

## Introduction

**Cryptography**, or **cryptology**, is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data **confidentiality**, data **integrity**, **authentication**, and **non-repudiation** are central to modern cryptography.

- **Confidentiality :** Limits access or places restrictions on certain types of information.
- **Integrity :** Assurance of, data accuracy and consistency over its entire life-cycle.
- **Authentication :** The act of proving an assertion, such as the identity of a computer system user. In contrast with identification, the act of indicating a person or thing's identity, authentication is the process of verifying that identity.
- **Non-repudiation :** Non-repudiation refers to a situation where a statement's author cannot successfully dispute its authorship or the validity of an associated contract.
